# Frequency-Constrained-Analysis-Using-Graph-Neural-Networks-on-a-9-Bus-System-
Investigated GNNs for frequency-constrained analysis on a modified 9-bus power system using PSCAD data. Trained on 7,749 scenarios with generator trips. GNN outperformed a baseline NN with lower RMSE for frequency nadir (0.0948 Hz) and RoCof (0.0945 Hz/s), showing better spatial awareness.
